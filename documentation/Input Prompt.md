Think of it like having a group chat with your friends, but with helpful AI agents that join the conversation - kind of like having knowledgeable friends who are experts in different areas hanging out in the chat. Here's how it works:

Core Experience:

- Start a group chat with your friends about any topic

- AI agents with different specialties are present in the chat

- Just @ mention any AI agent to get their specific help or insights

- The AI agents also listen to your conversations and can jump in with helpful suggestions when relevant

The AI Agents:

- Each AI agent has its own personality and expertise

- You can add custom AI agents based on what you need help with

- Some example agents could be:

  - @explorer for adventure recommendations

  - @foodie for restaurant tips

  - @planner for organizing itineraries

  - @budget for money-saving advice

  - @local for insider knowledge about specific places

Smart Features:

- AI agents learn from your chat conversations to understand preferences

- They can make group-friendly suggestions that match multiple people's interests

- Create quick polls when the group needs to make decisions

- Share and save recommendations directly from the chat

- AI agents remember context from previous conversations

Real-World Example: Imagine planning a trip to Paris with friends. You could ask "@foodie what are some great lunch spots near the Louvre?" while another friend asks "@budget what's the best way to get from the airport to our hotel?" The AI agents provide helpful, personalized responses while keeping track of everyone's preferences and the overall group dynamic.

The beauty is that it feels like a natural group chat, but with intelligent AI assistants that make planning and decision-making easier and more fun for everyone involved. The AI agents become like additional members of your group, each bringing their own expertise to help out.
